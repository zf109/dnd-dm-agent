## Encounters

### Giant Rats (CR 1/8 each)
**Quantity**: 2-3 rats depending on party size

**Behavioral Details**: They move with coordinated pack tactics, chittering to each other in what almost sounds like language. When threatened, they rear up on hind legs, displaying their impressive size.

**Story Purpose**: Immediate threat, evidence of magical transformation

### Final Encounter

### Potion of Invisibility

**Discovery Context**: Hidden behind a false panel in the laboratory, suggesting it was the wizard's emergency escape plan

### Potion of Vitality
**Description**: A robust bottle of emerald liquid that seems to pulse with life energy. Tiny motes of light dance within the green depths.
**Discovery Context**: The centerpiece of an unfinished experiment, surrounded by notes about enhancing life force

## Agent Decision Points

### When to Escalate Tension
- Party avoids cellar → Rats emerge into brewery proper, threatening customers
- Party stuck on puzzle → Magical resonance provides environmental clues or triggers helpful visions
- Combat too easy → Additional rats arrive, drawn by the sounds of battle
- Combat too hard → Injured rats retreat to defend their nest, allowing tactical repositioning

### How to Handle Player Choices
- **Avoid combat**: Provide stealth options through careful movement between barrels, or negotiation attempts using Animal Handling
- **Rush through**: Have consequences catch up (missed treasure, incomplete understanding leads to future problems)
- **Over-investigate**: Reward thoroughness with additional lore about the wizard, extra treasure, or useful magical knowledge

### Content Selection Guidelines
- **Combat encounters**: 1-2 Giant Rats per PC for balanced challenge, adjust based on party tactics
- **Skill challenges**: Emphasize Investigation for uncovering clues, Perception for avoiding hazards, and creative problem-solving
- **Treasure rewards**: Match party needs while maintaining the mystery of the ancient wizard's work

## Branching Outcomes

### Complete Success
- All rats eliminated, ruins fully explored, mystery solved
- Full payment plus bonus from grateful brewery owner
- Reputation spreads - other businesses may seek their pest control services
- Knowledge of the wizard's work may prove valuable in future adventures

### Partial Success  
- Rats eliminated but ruins not fully explored
- Standard payment, some mysteries remain
- Brewery safe but periodic magical effects may still occur
- Partial understanding of the magical processes involved

### Minimal Success
- Immediate rat threat handled but source not addressed
- Reduced payment, problem likely to return
- Brewery owner will need to seek additional help
- Missed opportunities for magical knowledge and treasure
