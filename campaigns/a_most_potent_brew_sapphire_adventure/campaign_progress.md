## Current Situation
Sapphire is in the Main Laboratory of the ancient wizard tower ruins. She has discovered that the apparatus creates Potions of Growth (explaining the giant rats), read the wizard's journal (revealing the wizard sealed the lab 200 years ago and never returned), and learned there may be secured specimens elsewhere. The apparatus still has intact potions in a protective case. A map sketch shows: Storage Vault (north), Living Quarters (east from entry), and a Hidden Study (location unclear). Sapphire has not yet collected the potions or disabled the apparatus.
