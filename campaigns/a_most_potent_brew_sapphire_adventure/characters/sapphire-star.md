## 📖 Character Concept

Sapphire Star earned her nickname after accidentally creating a spectacular light display that saved her village from bandits. Though small in stature, her magical talent and quick wit make her a formidable companion. She left her farming community to learn more about her gift, hoping to return one day as a proper wizard.

**Personality:**
- Cheerful and optimistic, sees adventure as exciting rather than dangerous
- Quick to help those in need, especially common folk
- Curious about magic but sometimes reckless in experimentation

**Ideal:** **Freedom** - Everyone deserves to live without oppression (Chaotic)

**Bond:** I seek to use my magic to protect ordinary people like those in my village

**Flaw:** I'm too trusting of those who appear to be in need
