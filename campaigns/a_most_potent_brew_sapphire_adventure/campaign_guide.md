## Agent Decision Points

### When to Escalate Tension
- Party avoids cellar → Rats emerge into brewery proper, threatening customers
- Party stuck on puzzle → Magical resonance provides environmental clues or triggers helpful visions
- Combat too easy → Additional rats arrive, drawn by the sounds of battle
- Combat too hard → Injured rats retreat to defend their nest, allowing tactical repositioning

### How to Handle Player Choices
- **Avoid combat**: Provide stealth options through careful movement between barrels, or negotiation attempts using Animal Handling
- **Rush through**: Have consequences catch up (missed treasure, incomplete understanding leads to future problems)
- **Over-investigate**: Reward thoroughness with additional lore about the wizard, extra treasure, or useful magical knowledge

### Content Selection Guidelines
- **Combat encounters**: 1-2 Giant Rats per PC for balanced challenge, adjust based on party tactics
- **Skill challenges**: Emphasize Investigation for uncovering clues, Perception for avoiding hazards, and creative problem-solving
- **Treasure rewards**: Match party needs while maintaining the mystery of the ancient wizard's work
