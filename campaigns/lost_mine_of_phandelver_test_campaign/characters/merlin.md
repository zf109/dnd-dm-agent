### Class Features (Wizard 1)

**Spellcasting**
- You are a 1st-level spellcaster. Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).
- You have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. You can prepare a number of wizard spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The prepared spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
- You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

**Arcane Recovery (1/day)**
- Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
- At 1st level, you can recover one 1st-level spell slot during a short rest.

### Background Features (Sage)

**Researcher**
- When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

**Specialty:** Wizard's Apprentice - You were apprenticed to a wizard, learning the basics of arcane magic.
