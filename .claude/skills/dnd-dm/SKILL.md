# D&D Dungeon Master Techniques

Practical techniques for running engaging D&D sessions with strong narration, good pacing, and player engagement.

## Core Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
**Describe what players experience, not the outcome:**
- ❌ "The goblin dies"
- ✅ "Your blade connects. The goblin's eyes widen as it crumples to the ground"

**Use sensory details:** sight, sound, smell, touch, taste

### Yes, And...
- Build on player ideas rather than blocking
- Turn "no" into "you can try, but..." with a DC check
- Reward creative problem-solving

### Fail Forward
- Failed checks should advance the story with complications
- Never let one roll completely block progress on critical paths

### Pacing
- **Vary rhythm:** Combat → exploration → social → combat
- **Rule of three:** After 3 failures, provide a clue
- **20-minute rule:** If stuck for 20 min, add complication or NPC

### Closing (5 min)
1. Stop at dramatic moment
2. Recap achievements
3. Award XP/rewards

## Running Combat

### Initiative & Narration
- Roll initiative (d20 + DEX modifier)
- Announce turn order clearly
- Describe hits and misses vividly:
  - **Hit:** "Your arrow pierces the rat's eye!"
  - **Miss:** "It dodges, your blade whistling past"

### Combat Pacing
- Keep turns under 1 minute
- Describe terrain and environment
- Track HP narratively: "It looks bloodied" (< 50% HP)
- **End early:** Skip "cleanup rounds" - narrate victory when obvious

## Ability Checks

### When to Roll
- **Don't roll:** Trivial tasks, impossible tasks, no interesting failure
- **Do roll:** Outcome uncertain AND both success/failure are interesting

### Setting DCs
| Difficulty | DC | Example |
|------------|----|---------  |
| Very Easy | 5 | Climb knotted rope |
| Easy | 10 | Spot something obvious |
| Medium | 15 | Pick simple lock |
| Hard | 20 | Scale sheer cliff |
| Very Hard | 25 | Recall obscure lore |

### Calling for Checks
- Be specific: "Give me a Perception check"
- Explain stakes: "On success, you spot the trap before triggering it"

## Improvisation

### When Players Go Off-Script
1. Pause briefly: "Let me check something" (buys 30 seconds)
2. Reuse prepared content (NPCs, encounters from elsewhere)
3. Ask clarifying questions: "What are you hoping to achieve?"
4. Say yes, figure out how later

### Quick NPC Generator
When players talk to unexpected NPCs:
- **Name:** Something simple (Bran, Mira, Kort)
- **Quirk:** One memorable detail (nervous laugh, missing finger)
- **Want:** What they need (usually simple: coin, safety, gossip)

## Roleplaying NPCs

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Don't force accents - quirks work better
- Keep consistent traits throughout
- Show emotion in your description

### Making NPCs Memorable
Pick ONE thing per NPC:
- Speech pattern ("Right?" after every sentence)
- Physical quirk (constantly adjusting glasses)
- Clear motivation (desperate to prove dragons exist)

### Quick Reactions
Use these when needed:
- **Hostile:** "Back off, or you'll regret it!"
- **Afraid:** "Please, I don't want trouble!"
- **Helpful:** "I might know something..."
- **Suspicious:** "Why should I trust you?"

## Player Engagement

### Spotlight Management
- Track who's had focus recently
- Direct questions: "Thork, what do you think?"
- Create moments for each class to shine

### When Players Are Stuck
1. Passive Perception: "You notice something..."
2. NPC arrives with information
3. Add time pressure: "You hear guards approaching"
4. Recap known clues

### Energy Management
- Read the room - add action if energy drops
- Break every 90 minutes
- Vary intensity: quiet → tense → explosive

## Quick Reference

### Common DCs
- Open stuck door: DC 13
- Track in wilderness: DC 15
- Recall common knowledge: DC 10
- Recall rare knowledge: DC 20

### Handling Edge Cases
- **"Can I roll X to do Y?"** → If reasonable, set DC; if impossible, "You can try but..."
- **Rules questions mid-session** → Make quick ruling, check later
- **Party splitting** → Keep scenes brief (5 min each), cut on cliffhangers

## Remember

Your job as DM:
1. **Player agency** - Let them drive the story
2. **Consequences** - Actions matter
3. **Description** - Paint vivid pictures
4. **Pacing** - Know when to speed up or slow down
5. **Fun** - If everyone's engaged, you're doing it right

**The goal is everyone has fun (including you).**
