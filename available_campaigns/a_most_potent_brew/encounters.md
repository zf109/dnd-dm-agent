# A Most Potent Brew - Encounters & Treasure

## Combat Encounters

### Giant Rats (CR 1/8 each)

**Quantity**: 2-3 rats depending on party size

**Physical Description**: These are no ordinary rats - each is the size of a medium dog, with matted black fur and eyes that gleam with unnatural intelligence. Their claws scrape against stone as they move, and their squeaks have an almost human quality.

**Behavioral Details**: They move with coordinated pack tactics, chittering to each other in what almost sounds like language. When threatened, they rear up on hind legs, displaying their impressive size.

**Tactics**:
- Swarm tactics (focus fire on single target)
- Retreat when reduced to 1 rat
- Use terrain (hide behind barrels, attack from elevation)

**Stats** (D&D 5e Giant Rat):
- AC: 12
- HP: 7 (2d6)
- Speed: 30 ft
- Attack: +4 to hit, 1d4+2 piercing damage
- Pack Tactics: Advantage on attacks if ally is within 5 feet of target

**Story Purpose**: Immediate threat, evidence of magical transformation

### Magical Puzzle/Trap

**Challenge**: Understanding potion effects and magical enlargement

**Visual Description**: A complex alchemical apparatus with bubbling tubes, crystalline containers, and measuring devices. Residual magic causes occasional sparks and color changes in the remaining liquids.

**Atmospheric Elements**: The air shimmers with magical energy, and touching certain components causes brief visions of the wizard who once worked here

**Solution Options**:
- **Investigation DC 12**: Understand the apparatus was for enlarging creatures
- **Arcana DC 13**: Recognize the magical signatures of transformation magic
- **Safely disable**: Careful manipulation (DEX check DC 10) or dispel magic

**Consequences**:
- Success: Gain insight into how rats were enlarged, find useful potions
- Failure: Trigger magical discharge (1d6 force damage, DEX save DC 12 for half)

**Difficulty**: Easy to moderate skill checks

**Story Purpose**: Introduce magical elements, reward problem-solving
