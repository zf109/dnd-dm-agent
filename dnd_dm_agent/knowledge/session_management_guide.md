## 📁 Directory Structure

When a game session is created, the following structure is automatically generated:

```
dnd_dm_agent/
└── game_sessions/
    └── [session_name]/
        ├── session_metadata.json
        ├── session_log.md
        └── characters/
            ├── [character_1].json
            ├── [character_1].md    ← Generated for human reading
            ├── [character_2].json
            ├── [character_2].md
            └── [character_n].json
```

## 🎮 Session Management Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Game Session

**Always create a session first** before any character creation:

```
DM Agent: "Welcome! Let's start your D&D adventure. What would you like to name this campaign?"
Player: "The Lost Mines of Phandelver"
DM Agent: Uses manage_game_session(action="create", session_name="The Lost Mines of Phandelver", dm_name="DM")
```

### 2. Character Creation Process

**Step-by-step character creation workflow:**

```
1. Get character name
2. Ask for class (use get_dnd_class_details for detailed info)
3. Ask for race/species  
4. Ask for background
5. Ask for alignment
6. Use tool_create_character(...) to create the character
7. Use guide_character_creation for step-by-step assistance
8. ALWAYS validate with tool_validate_character_readiness before gameplay
```

**Example:**
```
DM Agent: "Great! Now let's create your character. What's your character's name?"
Player: "Thorin Ironbeard"
DM Agent: "What class would you like to play? I can provide details about any class."
Player: "Tell me about Fighters"
DM Agent: Uses get_dnd_class_details("Fighter")
Player: "Fighter sounds good!"
DM Agent: Uses tool_create_character(session_name="The Lost Mines", 
                                    character_name="Thorin Ironbeard", 
                                    character_class="Fighter", race="Dwarf")
```

### 3. Character Validation & Readiness

**CRITICAL:** Always validate character readiness before starting gameplay:

```
DM Agent: Uses tool_validate_character_readiness(session_name, character_name)

If character is not ready:
- Use guide_character_creation to help fill missing information
- Required minimum fields: Name, Class & Level, Race, Background, Ability Scores, Hit Points, Armor Class
- Don't start adventures until all player characters are validated as ready
```

## 🔧 Character Sheet Management

### Primary Character Tools

Use the individual character management functions for all character operations:

- **tool_create_character()** - Create new characters with explicit parameters
- **tool_get_character()** - Retrieve existing character data  
- **tool_update_character()** - Update character fields using dictionary structure
- **tool_add_character_note()** - Add simple timestamped notes organized by session

---

## 🧠 Knowledge Access & Rules

### Dynamic Knowledge Tools

#### `lookup_knowledge(query, specific_files=None)`
- Search for D&D rules, mechanics, or general information
- Examples: `lookup_knowledge("advantage")`, `lookup_knowledge("Fighter", ["classes_5e"])`

#### `get_dnd_class_details(class_name)`
- Get comprehensive class information and features
- Examples: `get_dnd_class_details("Wizard")`, `get_dnd_class_details("Rogue")`

#### `get_dm_guidance(topic=None)`
- Access session management tips and best practices
- Examples: `get_dm_guidance("combat")`, `get_dm_guidance()` for full guide

#### `list_available_knowledge()`
- See what knowledge files are available in the system

## 🎲 During Gameplay

### Game State Management
```
DM Agent: Uses manage_game_state() for current location/scene tracking
DM Agent: Uses roll_dice() for ability checks, attacks, and random events
DM Agent: Uses update_session_log() to record important moments
```

### Character Progression Tracking
- **Always update character sheets** when:
  - Damage is taken or healed
  - Equipment changes (gained/lost items)
  - Level ups occur
  - Abilities change or improve
  - XP is gained

### Event Logging
```python
update_session_log("The Lost Mines", "Thorin discovered a secret passage with Investigation 18")
update_session_log("The Lost Mines", "Party defeated goblin ambush, gained 50 XP each")
update_session_log("The Lost Mines", "Elara reached Wizard level 2")
```
