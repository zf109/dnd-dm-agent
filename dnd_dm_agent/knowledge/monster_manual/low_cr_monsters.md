## Usage Notes for DMs

**Encounter Building:**
- CR 1/4 creatures work well in groups against 1st level parties
- CR 1/2 to 1 make good solo encounters for 1st-2nd level
- CR 2+ are dangerous for low-level parties unless used carefully

**Tactical Considerations:**
- Goblins use hit-and-run tactics with Nimble Escape
- Wolves and Dire Wolves benefit greatly from pack tactics
- Orcs are aggressive and charge into combat
- Undead are immune to many conditions but have specific vulnerabilities

**Environmental Usage:**
- Bears work well in wilderness/forest encounters
- Bandits are perfect for road encounters and humanoid conflicts
- Skeletons and zombies excel in dungeons and undead-themed adventures
- Owlbears are classic dungeon guardians and wilderness threats
