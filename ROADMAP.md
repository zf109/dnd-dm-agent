# D&D DM Agent Development Roadmap

*Last updated: 2025-01-31*

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a comprehensive AI Dungeon Master agent that can:
- Manage D&D game sessions with rich knowledge base
- Handle campaign progression and story development
- Provide combat guidance and rule assistance
- Track character development and party dynamics

## 🏗️ Development Philosophy

**Knowledge-First Approach**: Build comprehensive knowledge base as foundation for all other features.

**Single-Agent Architecture**: Maintain focused single agent with specialized tools (currently 11 tools - within best practices).

## 📋 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Knowledge Foundation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Research and catalog SRD 5.1 content from free sources
- [x] Plan knowledge file organization structure for SRD content  
- [x] Update knowledge tools to support recursive folder search
- [x] Implement regex-based search with specialized functions
- [x] Create spells folder structure and extract cantrips
- [x] Extract level 1 spells (most commonly used)
- [x] Extract monsters by creature type (low CR, dragons)
- [x] Update agent instructions and session guide for improved search
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for new search functionality

**Key Achievements:**
- Efficient search system with specialized functions (`get_spell_details`, `get_monster_details`, `get_dnd_class_details`)
- Folder-based knowledge organization (`player_handbook/spells/`, `monster_manual/`)
- Regex pattern support for advanced searches
- Comprehensive test suite with consistent mock patterns

### Phase 2: Story Module System 📋 **PRIORITY - IN PROGRESS**
**Rationale:** Story progression is a dependency for character advancement and accessing higher-level content. Without campaign management, we're stuck at levels 1-3 forever.

- [ ] Design campaign upload and storage system
- [ ] Implement adventure log extraction functionality  
- [ ] Create story progression tracking
- [ ] Build campaign module parser (support multiple formats)
- [ ] Add scene and narrative continuity tools
- [ ] Implement adventure skeleton generation from logs
- [ ] Create story branching and consequence tracking
- [ ] Add character advancement and leveling system integration

**Target Outcome:** Enable campaign progression so players can advance beyond level 3 and access higher-tier content.

**Key Features:**
- Upload campaign modules for structured adventures
- Extract player session logs to generate future adventure ideas
- Track story continuity and character narrative arcs
- Generate adventure hooks based on party history
- Character advancement and leveling system integration

**Example Workflows:**
- DM uploads "Lost Mine of Phandelver" → Agent can guide through structured adventure
- After sessions, agent extracts key events → Suggests follow-up adventure hooks
- Track recurring NPCs, locations, and plot threads across sessions
- Characters level up based on story milestones and XP progression

### Phase 3: Combat Enhancement System ⚔️ **PLANNED**
**Rationale:** Combat is a core D&D gameplay element needed immediately once story progression enables leveling and encounters.

- [ ] Implement initiative tracking and turn management
- [ ] Add tactical combat guidance system
- [ ] Create encounter balancing tools
- [ ] Build action economy optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add environmental hazard management
- [ ] Implement condition and status effect tracking
- [ ] Create dynamic encounter scaling based on party performance

**Key Features:**
- Smart initiative management with automated turn progression
- Tactical suggestions for both DM and players
- Real-time encounter difficulty adjustment
- Environmental storytelling integration with combat

**Target Outcome:** Smooth, engaging combat encounters that enhance story rather than interrupt it.

### Phase 4: Advanced Knowledge Expansion 📚 **PLANNED** 
**Rationale:** With story progression and combat systems working, we can now add the extensive high-level content.

- [ ] Expand classes folder structure (levels 1-20 progression)
- [ ] Extract level 2-9 spells for complete coverage
- [ ] Add higher CR monsters (medium/high level encounters)  
- [ ] Create magic items and equipment database
- [ ] Add character backgrounds and traits
- [ ] Extract epic monsters and legendary creatures
- [ ] Add lore and worldbuilding content
- [ ] Create advanced DM guidance for high-level play

**Target Outcome:** Complete D&D 5e SRD knowledge coverage for levels 1-20 gameplay.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features 🚀 **FUTURE**
- [ ] Multi-session campaign memory and continuity
- [ ] Player preference learning and adaptation
- [ ] Procedural content generation (NPCs, locations, quests)
- [ ] Integration with external tools (Roll20, D&D Beyond)
- [ ] Voice interaction capabilities
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
